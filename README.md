## How SwiftFlow Works
SwiftFlow operates on a simple yet powerful principle: adapt and optimize. Here's a glimpse into its core functionality:

1. Task Creation and Configuration: Define tasks with customizable execution blocks, priorities, and optional retry and timeout configurations.
2. Dynamic Task Queueing: Tasks are queued based on priority, with the ability to dynamically adjust priorities over time.
3. Concurrent Execution: Tasks are executed concurrently, respecting the system's processing capabilities and current load.
4. Performance Monitoring: SwiftFlow continuously monitors task performance, adjusting concurrency levels to optimize throughput and efficiency.
5. Completion Handling: On task completion, performance metrics are recorded, and any registered completion handlers are invoked.
   
## Installation

Clone the SwiftFlow repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jwoody02/SwiftFlow.git
```
copy `SwiftFlow.swift` from the Sources folder into your project. That's it!

# Usage
## Creating a Task
To create a task in SwiftFlow, create a new `TaskBuilder` instance and make sure to pass in the return type (e.g. String, Data, etc). Place any code the task should complete in the `executionBlock`and call `completion(<return value>)` when done. `.then` is an optional function that is chainable, similar to JavaScript's `.then` function, and make sure to call `.build` at the end:
```swift
let task = TaskBuilder<ReturnType>()
    .with(identifier: "uniqueTaskIdentifier")
    .with(priority: .medium)
    .with(executionBlock: { completion in
        // Task execution logic
        // Call completion(.success(data)) or completion(.failure(error)) when done
    })
    .then { result, metrics in
        // First completion handler
        // Handle the task result and metrics here
    }
    .then { result, metrics in
        // Additional completion handlers can be chained
    }
    .build()
```
Note: Simply creating a task does not automatically queue it for execution. This step only defines the task and its completion logic.

## Executing a Task
SwiftFlow provides three different ways to execute a task, each catering to different use cases:
### 1. Executing a Task Through SwiftFlow's Task Manager
This is the standard way to execute a task. It involves adding the task to SwiftFlow's task queue, where it's managed and executed based on its priority and the system's current load. This method is ideal for tasks that need to be managed and scheduled by SwiftFlow.
```swift
// Example of adding a task to SwiftFlow's task manager
let task = // ... [task creation code]
SwiftFlow.shared.addTask(task)
```
In this method, the task's completion handlers (defined via `.then`) are automatically called once the task is completed.

### 2. Direct Execution with Completion Handling
If you need immediate execution of a task without adding it to SwiftFlow's queue, you can directly call the `execute()` method with a completion block. This method is useful when you want to run a task immediately and handle its completion in one place.
```swift
// Example of executing a task immediately with a completion block
task.execute {
    // This block is called after all of the task's completion handlers have been executed
}
```
This method will execute all completion blocks added through the `.then` method, followed by the final completion block specified in `execute()`.

### 3. Direct Execution without Completion Handling
If you want to execute a task immediately and do not need any additional handling after the task's predefined completion logic, you can call the `execute()` method without any parameters. This is the simplest form of task execution, suitable when you just need to run a task and rely entirely on its predefined completion logic.
```swift
// Example of executing a task immediately without additional completion handling
task.execute()
```
This method executes the task and its chained .then completion handlers, but does not provide an additional completion block.

Each of these execution methods offers flexibility in how tasks are managed and executed, allowing SwiftFlow to be adaptable to different scenarios and requirements.

## Adding listeners for Task Completion
SwiftFlow allows you to add multiple listeners for a task, enabling different parts of your application to respond to the task's completion:
```swift
SwiftFlow.shared.addListener(for: "your-task-id") { result in
    self.handleTaskResult(result)
}
```
This feature is particularly useful for tasks that have wide-reaching effects or need to notify multiple components upon completion.
# Task Classes
## Example: Image Downloading Task
SwiftFlow allows tasks to be easily defined as a class, making for easy initialization and clean code, here's an example of a Task class for downloading images:
```swift
class ImageDownloadTask: Task<Data> {
    let imageURL: URL

    init(imageURL: URL, priority: TaskPriority, completions: @escaping (TaskResult<Data>, TaskMetrics) -> Void) {
        self.imageURL = imageURL
        super.init(
            identifier: imageURL.absoluteString,
            priority: priority,
            executionBlock: { completion in
                // Perform the actual download
                URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: imageURL) { data, response, error in
                    // Check for errors, invalid response, or no data
                    if let error = error {
                        completion(.failure(error))
                        return
                    }
                    guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, 200..<300 ~= httpResponse.statusCode else {
                        completion(.failure(TaskError.noResult))
                        return
                    }
                    guard let data = data else {
                        completion(.failure(TaskError.noResult))
                        return
                    }
                    // If everything is fine, return the downloaded data
                    completion(.success(data))
                }.resume()
            },
            completions: [completions]
        )
    }
}
```
And here's how we can use the previous class to cleanly download an image using SwiftFlow's priority queue and pass the results back:
```swift
let imageDownloadTask = ImageDownloadTask(
        imageURL: URL("https://example.com/test.png"),
        priority: .medium,
        completions: { result, metrics in
            switch result {
            case .success(let data):
                // Handle successful image download, e.g., cache or display the image
            case .failure(let error):
                // Handle error scenario
            }
        }
    )
    SwiftFlow.shared.addTask(imageDownloadTask)
```
## Example: HTTP Requester Task
```swift
class NetworkRequestTask: Task<Data> {
    let urlRequest: URLRequest

    init(urlRequest: URLRequest, priority: TaskPriority, completions: @escaping (TaskResult<Data>, TaskMetrics) -> Void) {
        self.urlRequest = urlRequest
        super.init(
            identifier: "NetworkRequest-\(urlRequest.url?.absoluteString ?? "unknown")",
            priority: priority,
            executionBlock: { completion in
                let session = URLSession.shared
                let task = session.dataTask(with: urlRequest) { data, response, error in
                    // Handle errors
                    if let error = error {
                        completion(.failure(error))
                        return
                    }

                    // Validate the response
                    guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
                          200..<300 ~= httpResponse.statusCode else {
                        completion(.failure(TaskError.noResult))
                        return
                    }

                    // Ensure data is received
                    guard let data = data else {
                        completion(.failure(TaskError.noResult))
                        return
                    }

                    // Success
                    completion(.success(data))
                }
                task.resume()
            },
            completions: [completions]
        )
    }
}

// Example Usage
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = method

// Add additional request configurations if necessary (e.g., headers, body)

let networkTask = NetworkRequestTask(
    urlRequest: request,
    priority: priority,
    completions: { result, metrics in
        switch result {
        case .success(let data):
            // Handle successful network response
        case .failure(let error):
            // Handle error scenario
        }
    }
)
SwiftFlow.shared.addTask(networkTask)
```

## Example: I/O Task
```swift
class FileIOTask: Task<Data> {
    let filePath: String
    let operation: FileIOOperation

    enum FileIOOperation {
        case read
        case write(data: Data)
    }

    init(filePath: String, operation: FileIOOperation, priority: TaskPriority) {
        self.filePath = filePath
        self.operation = operation
        super.init(
            identifier: "FileIO-\(filePath)",
            priority: priority,
            executionBlock: { completion in
                switch operation {
                case .read:
                    // Implement file read logic
                case .write(let data):
                    // Implement file write logic
                }
            },
            completions: []
        )
    }
}
```

## Detailed Example: Concurrent HTTP Requests
There's a practical example using SwiftFlow to manage concurrent HTTP requests using our `NetworkRequestTask` as defined above. Note: if you use this example, please make sure to include the network request task code above:
```swift

class ExampleClass {
    func createHTTPRequestTask(urlString: String, priority: TaskPriority) -> Task<Data> {
        
        // Example Usage
        let request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: urlString)!)

        // Add additional request configurations if necessary (e.g., headers, body)

        let networkTask = NetworkRequestTask(
            urlRequest: request,
            priority: priority,
            completions: { result, metrics in
                switch result {
                case .success(let data):
                    // Handle successful network response
                    print("Successfully executed task requesting \(urlString)")
                case .failure(let error):
                    // Handle error scenario
                    print("Failed to execute task requesting \(urlString)")
                }
            }
        )
        
        return networkTask
    }

    func executeExample() {
        let urls = ["https://api.publicapis.org/entries", "https://api.agify.io/?name=bella"]
        urls.forEach { urlString in
            let httpRequestTask = createHTTPRequestTask(urlString: urlString, priority: .medium)
            SwiftFlow.shared.addTask(httpRequestTask)
        }

        SwiftFlow.shared.debugPrintQueueStatus()
    }
}
```
In this example, `ExampleClass` demonstrates how to use SwiftFlow to handle multiple HTTP requests concurrently. Each request is encapsulated in a task with its own completion logic. The tasks are then queued and executed efficiently by SwiftFlow.

## Detailed Example: Self-Starting Image Downloading Task
```swift
// Image download task that returns a UIImage and handles automatic caching
class ImageDownloadTask: Task<UIImage> {
    let imageURL: URL
    
    init(imageURL: URL, priority: TaskPriority, autoEnqueue: Bool = true, completion: @escaping (TaskResult<UIImage>, TaskMetrics) -> Void) {
        self.imageURL = imageURL
        
        // Custom configuration that limits execution time to 5 seconds, retries a max of 2 times
        let taskConfig = TaskConfiguration(maxRetries: 2, executionTimeout: 5.0)
        super.init(
            identifier: "image-download-\(imageURL.absoluteString)",
            priority: priority,
            executionBlock: { taskCompletion in
                // Check if the image is cached
                if let cachedResponse = URLCache.shared.cachedResponse(for: URLRequest(url: imageURL)),
                   let image = UIImage(data: cachedResponse.data) {
                    taskCompletion(.success(image))
                } else {
                    // If not cached, download the image
                    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: imageURL) { data, response, error in
                        if let error = error {
                            taskCompletion(.failure(error))
                            return
                        }
                        
                        guard let data = data, let image = UIImage(data: data), let response = response else {
                            taskCompletion(.failure(TaskError.noResult))
                            return
                        }
                        
                        // Cache the downloaded image
                        let cachedData = CachedURLResponse(response: response, data: data)
                        URLCache.shared.storeCachedResponse(cachedData, for: URLRequest(url: imageURL))
                        
                        taskCompletion(.success(image))
                    }.resume()
                }
            },
            completions: [completion],
            configuration: taskConfig // make sure to set custom config
        )
        
        if autoEnqueue {
            SwiftFlow.shared.addTask(self)
        }
    }
}

// Example usage, no need to manually add it to the queue
// This task will automatically run if autoEnqueue is set to true
ImageDownloadTask(
    imageURL: URL(string: "https://example.com/image.jpg")!,
    priority: .low,
    completion: { result, metrics in
        switch result {
        case .success(let image):
            // Use the image in your app
            print("Image downloaded or fetched from cache successfully")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Image download failed: \(error)")
        }
    }
)
```
I don't recommend using this exact code in a production application, as it's only a basic downloading and caching mechanism, however, in conjunction with `KingFisher` or some other framework more akin to efficiently downloading images, it would work well.

# How SwiftFlow's Adaptive Concurrency Works
SwiftFlow features an advanced adaptive concurrency mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of concurrent tasks based on system load and task performance metrics. This approach ensures optimal utilization of system resources while maintaining responsive performance.

## System Load Monitoring
 - **CPU and Memory Load Levels**: SwiftFlow monitors CPU and memory usage, allowing users to define threshold levels (low, medium, high) for each.
 - **Dynamic Load Assessment**: The system continually assesses the current CPU and memory loads against these user-defined thresholds.
   
## Adaptive Concurrency Adjustment
 - **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Load and Performance**:
      - When both CPU and memory loads are below their respective thresholds and the task success rate is high, SwiftFlow increases concurrency to maximize throughput.
      - If either CPU or memory load exceeds its threshold, or if the task success rate falls below a set threshold (e.g., 80%), SwiftFlow reduces concurrency to alleviate system strain.
 - **Manual Concurrency Control**: Users can manually set a maximum number of concurrent tasks, overriding the adaptive mechanism.

## Diagrammatic Representation
Below is a diagram illustrating SwiftFlow's adaptive concurrency mechanism over time:

 - "System Load": A value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%) that represents the systems current load. 
 - "Load Threshold": A value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%) indicating the target system load SwiftFlow tries to keep under.
 - "Max Concurrent Tasks": A value ranging from 1 to the number of active CPUs and is the maximum allowed tasks that can run concurrently.

The diagram shows how the concurrency level is adjusted based on the balance between maintaining a high success rate and keeping system load within user-defined limits. As tasks consistently complete within the ideal time frame without overloading the system, SwiftFlow gradually allows more tasks to run concurrently, enhancing overall efficiency.

![Diagram](documentation/concurrencyprocess.png)

In essence, SwiftFlow intelligently balances task throughput with system performance, ensuring that tasks are executed as efficiently as possible while maintaining minimal latency and respecting system load constraints.
